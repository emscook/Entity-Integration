# Entity Integration Assignment
You are tasked with completing the integration of the Project entity into an existing application. The application is a management back end meant to store and retrieve information about Project Managers and their associated Projects. The Project and Project Manager entities already exist, but there is no repository, service, or controller for the Project entity. It will be your task to create these items, add additional fields to the entities, and add search features to allow for sensible retrieval of data.

## Running the Project

This project will use a different toolset than normal to run & test.

### Database
This project uses an embedded database, meaning that you will not be able to inspect the data in the database directly. The most direct way to inspect the data is to use REST endpoints.

### Running
1. Navigate to the directory of the project in the command line
2. run `mvn clean install`
3. Navigate to the `target` directory in the project
4. run `java -jar Entity-Integration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### Testing
Use PostMan to test the endpoints

## Tasks
- [X] Create `Project` Repository
- [X] Create `Project` Service
- [X] Create `Project` Controller
- [X] Add a `StartDate` field to the `Project` entity
- [X] Add a `DueDate` field to the `Project` entity
- [X] Add an endpoint to allow for the retrieval of all overdue projects
- [X] Add an endpoint `/projectManager/{id}/project` that will retrieve a collection of all projects associated with that `ProjectManager`
- [X] Add an endpoint to allow searching for all `ProjectManager` entities with overdue projects. In the results, display the number of overdue projects associated with each `ProjectManager`. Sort the results from largest to smallest number of overdue projects.
